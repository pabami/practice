Very beginner

I am very new to coding or anything like programming. My school needs something like SIS or LMS, so we were trying to buy one or develop one.
We bought a solution but, it hasn't suited us well and required us money for any change. We need many different functions and forms to print the data of our students, so we were trying to find a way to develop our own program. Since my school is small and doesn't have much money, requesting a professional company was not affordable. 
In a nutshell, I decided to give it a try to develop it by myself by using Moodle. 
Please wish me a good luck. If I feel overwhelmed and impossible to learn coding and make the system within limited time, I will just give up.
